Researchers at [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-source-data) have aggregated data on COVID-19 cases, deaths, vaccinations, etc from various sources such as WHO and Johns Hopkins University, and made it available in a GitHub repository.

I will be using this dataset to visualize various COVID-19 related metrics, and also test some hypotheses relating to the nature of COVID-19 cases.
